# Examples

Drop small, reproducible examples here, for instance:

- minimal synthetic time-series that grows exponentially with noise
- a tiny excerpt of field snapshots (or generated toy data) to validate plateau selection

Avoid committing huge simulation outputs; prefer small slices or generators.
