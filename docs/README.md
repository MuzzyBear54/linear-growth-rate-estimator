# Docs

This folder is optional. Suggested contents as the repo matures:

- `theory.md` — brief notes on the instability growth model, what γ means, and common failure modes.
- `data_requirements.md` — what diagnostics are needed and how to export them.
- `cli.md` — CLI reference once `argparse` is in place.
